# communicaty-demo
A demo account for my B2B SaaS product that is in production.

If you're interested in what I've built follow the demo below to see the power of Communicaty for local governments!

There's two parts to the platform, the public facing contact portal, and an admin dashboard to reach those contacts. I'll walk you through both.

## Contact Registration
First, sign up as a contact: (skip the address if you want)
https://communicaty.com/app/portal/1597002265263/signup

That's it, super easy!

## Admin Dashboard
Then, head over to the admin panel to send a message
https://communicaty.com/app/login
user: tester123
password: Tester123!

Once logged in, to start crafting your message hit the (+) button on the left hand nav bar.
### 1. Select Contacts
To select yourself, click on 'Rules' then hit 'Select All Contacts'.

Then press 'Next'.

### 2. Select Notification Type
Choose the default notification 'Emergency Alerts'.

### 3. Craft a message to send to yourself
You can write anything in the message box, short and sweet!

### 4. Select Delivery Types
Blast it out! Select Email and Text Message.

### 5. Schedule
You want to receive the message ASAP, so hit 'Next'.

### 6. Review
Everything should be good here, click 'Create Message' and watch the magic happen!

Thanks for walking through the demo with me, I hope you've enjoyed using Communicaty.
